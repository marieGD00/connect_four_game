# connect_four_game
Here I was asked to develop a connect four game using C and create an interactive user interface for the players to play.
A unique feature we had to code in was that when a player rotates the board 90 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise we had to simulate the pawns inside the game to fall the way they would with gravity and see if by rotating the game any of the players would end with a win ( 4 of the same colour side by side).
All my tests to test the different scenarios of the game are in evidence.c . The files with the main code are in board.c where I create the board, play.c, and pos.c, and logic.c where I set out how the game plays out.
