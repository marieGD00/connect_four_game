# connect_four_game
I developed an interactive user interface for two players to play the well known Connect four game.
A unique feature which I added in is that players have the ability to rotate their board 90 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise. If by rotating the pawns fall to create consecutive fours the player wins. 
All my tests are in the file named in evidence.c. 
The creation of the board in in board.c and the rest of the code is in files play.c, and pos.c, and logic.c where I set out how the game plays out.
